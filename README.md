# Phaser Webpack 4 Boilerplate
Greetings for everybody.

I've done a very basic but fancy boilerplate for development with Phaser and ES6 using Webpack 4.

Phaser is a game development engine made with Javascript and has a big success into the game development community.
Now I've added ES6 support (well maybe it has been done before) for making cleaner code than vanilla style.

Feel free to use it in practices, sandboxes and productive developments.

## Installation and Deployment
For installation, just execute these line commands:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/RZEROSTERN/webpack4-phaser-boilerplate.git
$ cd webpack4-phaser-boilerplate
$ npm install
```

After installation, just use this comments for starting your development:

- Use webpack hot-reloading features
```bash
npm run serve
```
- Build for development
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Build for production
```
npm run build
```
