# Phaser Webpack 4 Boilerplate
Greetings for everybody.

I've done a very basic but fancy boilerplate for development with Phaser and ES6 using Webpack 4.

Phaser is a game development engine made with Javascript and has a big success into the game development community.
Now I've added ES6 support (well maybe it has been done before) for making cleaner code than vanilla style.

Feel free to use it in practices, sandboxes and productive developments.

## Installation and Deployment
For installation, just execute this line commands:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/RZEROSTERN/webpack4-phaser-boilerplate.git
$ cd webpack4-phaser-boilerplate
$ npm install
```

After installation, just use this comments for starting your development:

- Use webpack hot-reloading features
```bash
npm run serve
```
- Build for development
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Build for production
```
npm install
```

### Next Steps

- Documentation
- Publishing as NPM package
- Electron Packaging (Want to publish as desktop app huh ?)

### Licensing
Phaser Webpack 4 boilerplate is released under the MIT License.

Phaser is property of Photon Storm Limited. For documentation, visit their website [here](http://phaser.io/) or its 
GitHub [here](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser)

Want to buy me a beer or a coffee? Feel free to donate a buck (or two). 

Don't worry, this development is completely free
but your donations and contribution can make bigger this boilerplate.
